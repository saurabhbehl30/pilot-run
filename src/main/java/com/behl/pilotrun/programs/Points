## 2PC works as a single commit and aims to perform ACID transactions on distributed systems.
 It is used wherever strong consistency is important. On the other hand, SAGA works sequentially,
  not as a single commit. Each operation gets committed before the subsequent one, and this makes
  the data eventually consistent.
